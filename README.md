## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my solution for the Social Links Profile coding challenge! In this project, I've aimed to replicate the provided design as closely as possible using HTML and CSS.

This challenge was provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), which offers a platform for developers to enhance their coding skills by tackling real-world projects.

## Challenge Overview

The task was to create a social links profile where users can see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page. This involves building both the mobile and desktop versions of the design, ensuring responsiveness and attention to detail.

## Technologies Used

To accomplish this challenge, I used HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling and layout. No JavaScript was required for this project since it's a static design.

## Project Structure

- `/design`: Contains design mockups for both mobile and desktop versions.
- `/assets`: Includes all required assets such as images and fonts.
- `index.html`: HTML file for the project's structure.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `README.md`: This file, serving as project documentation.

## Building Process

1. **Project Setup**: Initialized the project as a public repository on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
2. **HTML Structure**: Started by structuring the content using semantic HTML, focusing on accessibility and readability.
3. **Base Styles**: Set up base styles for the project, including font family, font size, and general layout.
4. **Styling Components**: Styled each section of the page incrementally, starting from the top and working my way down.
5. **Hover and Focus States**: Implemented hover and focus states for interactive elements to enhance user experience.

## Challenges Faced

While working on this project, I encountered some challenges, particularly in achieving pixel-perfect alignment and managing responsive design across different screen sizes.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in translating design mockups into code, improving my CSS skills, and understanding the importance of attention to detail in web development.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Frontend Mentor for providing this challenge and the opportunity to enhance my skills.
